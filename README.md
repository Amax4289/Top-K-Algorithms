# Top-K Algorithms

Implementation of the following two Top-K Algorithms in Java:
1. Fagin Algorithm
2. Threshold Algorithm
***
The code is designed for a specific example from a University Assignment, specifically we have 3 Systems with the following answers:
> 1. Ans(q,S1) = < (E, 0.9), (F,0.8), (Î‘, 0.8), (B, 0.7), (D, 0.4), (C, 0.2), >
> 2. Ans(q,S2) = < (C, 0.8), (A, 0.7), (F,0.6), (D, 0.5), (B, 0.5), (E, 0.1) >
> 3. Ans(q,S3) = < (C, 0.7), (A, 0.7), (E, 0.7), (D,0.4), (F, 0.4), (B, 0.4) >
***
When running the program you are asked to choose your algorithm and then the 'K' value.
